As the kids of today transition into the jobs of tomorrow, they will face an ever-increasing array of automation and robots doing simple tasks. If there is any doubt, see advances in Driverless Cars, Cashier-less retail stores, Alexa, and Siri. All these jobs require lots of Math, Physics, and Engineering. But above all, it will require programming skills and machine learning to automate simple tasks. Python is the fastest growing programming language that is widely considered an industry standard.
