# **PyKidsClub** 

PyKidsClub is a 100% Student Run Organization located in Charlotte, NC. We offer online Computer Science courses designed to help students of all ages learn the basics of programming and apply them to their STEM concepts at school and careers in the future. 

## **Our Mission**

As our mission of the Computer Science courses is to enrich the knowledge and future capabilities of our local students through lectures, we also strive to enrich the future of other students worldwide. Many students in underdeveloped countries don't even have access to technology to learn. Technology is vital to learn math and science concepts of the future. We hope through donations, fundraisers, and classes, we can solve the digital divide in underdeveloped countries and fight against lack of education and technology resources. Our dream is to provide students all over the globe an equal and fair chance at becoming the creators of the future. 50% of our profits will support this cause.
